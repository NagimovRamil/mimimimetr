# "Mimimimetr"
In the movie "The Social Network" there is this episode: a young Mark Zuckerberg wrote an application in which you could vote for one of two proposed college students by clicking on her photo. After the first choice, the next pair of girls was shown. And so on, until all the pairs run out. Pairs are selected randomly, but there are no repetitions of pairs.
When the pairs are over, the user is shown the top students, collected from the votes of all users.

We propose to write a similar application, where instead of female students it will be necessary to evaluate cats.
